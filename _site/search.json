But many are built on too little data, leading to inaccurate results—especially for underrepresented groups.

    "text": "What the ‘pmsims’ project about?\n\nNHS services use prediction tools to help make decisions about patient care. These tools rely on data to estimate what might happen in the future, like someone’s risk of developing a health condition.\nHowever, if the tools are built using too little data, their predictions can be inaccurate or unfair, particularly for people from underrepresented communities.\nWe’re building a free, easy-to-use tool to help researchers estimate how much data they to build accurate and fair prediction models—including newer approaches that use complex methods like machine learning. We’re working closely with patients and the public to understand their views, make our work accessible, and raise awareness of the risks associated with using too little information. Our goal is to improve the fairness and accuracy of prediction tools used in healthcare.\n\n\n\nWhat is prediction modelling?\n\nPrediction modelling uses statistics or computer algorithms to estimate what might happen in the future. More and more of these models are being created as larger datasets and better tools become available.\nFor example, the QRISK tool estimates a person’s risk of developing heart disease in the next 10 years. Doctors use it to decide who should be offered treatment to help prevent heart problems.\n\n\n\nWhy is sample size important?\n\nMany prediction models are developed using too little data. When this happens, the model can become too focused on the specific details of the sample it was trained on, rather than learning general patterns that apply more widely. This is known as overfitting. It means the model might appear accurate during development but make unreliable or unfair predictions in real-world settings.\nSmall samples are especially problematic when making predictions for minoritised groups, as limited representation can lead to inaccurate and unfair predictions, potentially resulting in incorrect or even harmful treatment recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n Sample size: 100  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will this project help?\n\nAn essential first step in building a model is estimating how much data is needed.\nWe’re creating a simple, user-friendly tool that estimates the minimum amount of data needed for different types of prediction models. It does this by generating synthetic (artificial) data of different sizes and testing how well models perform with each one.\nThis will help researchers decide how complex their model should be—and help prevent models being developed without enough data, which can lead to inaccurate or unfair predictions and wasted research effort."
