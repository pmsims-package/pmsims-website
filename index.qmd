We're creating a free, easy-to-use tool to help researchers calculate
how much data they need to build accurate and reliable prediction models
using machine learning and long-term health records. Developed in
partnership with patients, carers, and charities, the tool will support
safer, fairer, and more effective use of data in healthcare.

Prediction models are already helping the NHS personalise care, plan
treatments, and prevent illness before it starts. But many are built on
too little data, leading to inaccurate results---especially for
underrepresented groups. Our project addresses this problem by providing
practical guidance on the data needed to develop models that are both
powerful and fair.

# Who is involved?

This project is led by a team at [King's College London]() and funded by the
[National Institute for Health and Care Research]() as part of the Research
for Patient Benefit Programme. [Click here](about.qmd) to learn more
