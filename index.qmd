  <p>Tools to estimate minimum sample sizes for prediction and machine learning models</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

We're creating a free, easy-to-use tool to help researchers calculate
how much data they need to build accurate and reliable prediction models
using machine learning and long-term health records. Developed in
partnership with patients, carers, and charities, the tool will support
safer, fairer, and more effective use of data in healthcare.

Prediction models are already helping the NHS personalise care, plan
treatments, and prevent illness before it starts. But many are built on
too little data, leading to inaccurate results---especially for
underrepresented groups. Our project addresses this problem by providing
practical guidance on the data needed to develop models that are both
powerful and fair.

This project is led by a team at [King's College London]() and funded by the
[National Institute for Health and Care Research]() as part of the Research
for Patient Benefit Programme. To learn more, [see below](#about).

# What is the 'pmsims' project about?

* NHS services use prediction tools to [help make decisions about patient
  care.]{.hl} These tools rely on data to estimate what might happen in the
  future, like someone's risk of developing a health condition.

* However, if the tools are built using too little data, their predictions
  can be [inaccurate or unfair]{.hl}, particularly for people from
  underrepresented communities.

* We're building a free, easy-to-use tool to help researchers estimate [how
  much data they need]{.hl} to build accurate and fair prediction
  models---including newer approaches that use complex methods like machine
  learning.

* We're working with patients and the public to understand their views,
  ensure accessibility, and raise awareness of the risks associated with using
  too little information. Our goal is to improve the fairness and accuracy of
  prediction tools used in healthcare.

# How do prediction models work?

* Prediction modelling uses [statistics or computer algorithms]{.hl} to
  estimate what might happen in the future. More and more of these models are
  being created as larger datasets and better tools become available.

* For example, the [QRISK](https://www.qrisk.org/) tool estimates a
  person's risk of developing heart disease in the next 10 years. Doctors use
  it to decide who should be offered treatment to help prevent heart problems.

# Why sample size matters in prediction

* Many prediction models are developed using [too little data]{.hl}. When this
  happens, the model can become too focused on the specific details of the
  sample it was trained on, rather than learning general patterns that apply
  more widely. This is known as [overfitting]{.hl}. It means the model might
  appear accurate during development but make unreliable or unfair predictions
  in real-world settings.

* Small samples are especially problematic when making predictions for
  minoritised groups, as limited representation can lead to inaccurate and
  unfair predictions, potentially resulting in incorrect or even harmful
  treatment recommendations.
